# Project Requirements:

   ## Framework Selection:
        Must use one of the following frameworks: React, Angular, or Vue.js.
        Provide a brief overview of your choice and Justify your choice based on project requirements and other reasons.

   ## Agile Methodology:
        Create an Agile board on a platform like Jira, Azure DevOps, or GitHub Projects.
        Define clear Epics, Features, and User Stories to guide your development process.

   ## Source Code Management:
        Host your project's source code on GitHub.
        Ensure the repository is public and accessible for review.

   ## CI/CD Pipeline:
        Implement a GitHub Action to automate the deployment process.
        Deploy your application to a cloud platform of your choice (e.g., Azure, AWS, Netlify, Vercel, Heroku ).

   ## Web Application Features:
        Landing Page:
            Create a visually appealing landing page with semantic HTML elements.
            Include a compelling introduction to your project, incorporating text and narration.
        Routing and Navigation:
            Implement robust routing and navigation to guide users through the application.
            Ensure smooth transitions between different pages.
        Storytelling:
            Develop an engaging story that has a clear purpose.
            Consider themes like community engagement, personal branding (dynamic resume), or marketing.
        Data Handling and Filtering:
            Utilize data structures (Json with Schema) to store and manage information.
            Implement filtering and search capabilities to allow users to find specific content.
        Styling and Presentation:
            Employ CSS or a CSS-in-JS library to style your application.
            Prioritize a visually pleasing and user-friendly design.

   ## Best Practices:
        Adhere to frontend development best practices, including:
            Component-based architecture
            State management (e.g., Redux, Context API, Vuex)
            Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
            Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
            Performance optimization
