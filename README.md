# Skate-Park-WebApp
A solo implementation of an IPRO project, modified to fit a different prompt

# Project overview
    This website was made with the intention of being the online presence of a digitally smart skate park as part of an IPRO course at IIT.The purpose of the GoGo Skate Park website is to communicate with the community that visits the park and to encourage learning. The project features art, engineering graphs, and design input from my teammates throughout the site. 
  
# Technologies used
    Vue JS is seen throughout the project, though not in the typical Single Page Application (SPA). Filtering can be seen in the gallery page and a fun card feature pops up around several pages of the project. 

# Lessons Learned
    The biggest lesson is that while Vue is interesting, it can be difficult. It would also help to start from scratch and not shove it into an existing project with multiple pages. New CSS styles and shortcuts were also learned in the process. 

# Future scope
    This, interestingly enough, is the future implementation of the project. The original files weren't as complex and were meant to be used with react, but the final product wasn't up to my standards. I was happy enough to leave it be, but then Team GoGo (my IPRO team) won innovation day at Kaplan Inst. and was even invited to present at Chi Con. So the site was ripped apart and redone in the last weeks of November. 

    Future improvements might include another full redo, starting from the ground up with a fresh vue application and seeing how far I can get with an SPA
